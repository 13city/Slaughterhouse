# Open Snort.lua from an editor and update Set the network which you want to protect against attacks as the value for the HOME_NET variable, and point EXTERNAL_NET variable to HOME_NET variable.
# Save and exit.

... -- HOME_NET and EXTERNAL_NET must be set now -- setup the network addresses you are protecting
HOME_NET = 'server_public_IP/32'

-- set up the external network addresses.
-- (leave as "any" in most situations)
EXTERNAL_NET = 'any' EXTERNAL_NET = '!$HOME_NET' ...
